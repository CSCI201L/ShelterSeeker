Hi all

Commit guidelines:
You should make a branch for your issue called "issN" where N is the number of your issue. Commits should start with "#issN" where, again, N is the number of your issue. Issues have been assigned in the issues tab (shocking, I know). If you feel that your work doesn't relate to a current issue, make a new 1! :D
